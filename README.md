# Module-1
# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
I wanted to make a text-based game that anyone might find enjoyable. This was so I could learn Java Syntax.
{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}
I used the scanner and a lot of print statements. For each stage I had a method that would loop back using if statements. I used classes and inheritance so that everything connected well, but was abstracted enough that I could easily find an error if it showed up.
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
